# Commission Database

[Usage](Usage.md)

Commission Database, aka `cdb`, is a command line application keeping track of commission and YCH transactions. The information can later be imported into databases or modified externally from a spreadsheet program.

I welcome contribution to this project.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Rust 2018 edition
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Configuration

CRA expects a `config.toml` in the `/cdb` directory of your operating system's respective document's folder. If the file isn't found, it will use the default settings.

## Currency

The default currency is USD. This can be overwritten in the `config.toml` or `--currency` option. You must provide a [ISO-4127 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) in either case. The latter is for per-buyer bases whereas the former is for your region's currency.

```toml
currency = "EUR"
```

When giving a fee amount, you do not need to provide a decimal. The rounding would be done automatically by the program.

### Top Currencies

These are the ISO-4127 codes for the top currencies.

- JPY (Japanese Yen)
- EUR (Euro)
- CAD (Canadian Dollar)
- AUD (Australian Dollar)
- CHF (Swiss Franc)
- USD (US Dollar)
- GBP (British Pound)
